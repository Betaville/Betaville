/**
 * This class is used to propagate a color set by the application code to the
 * children / related components. For example, table and table header are two
 * different components, but are visually two parts of the same user-facing
 * control. Setting background on the table should be propagated to the table
 * header - unless the application code explicitly changed the background color
 * on the table header. This is where this class comes into play - to mark the
 * propagated color so that it can be replaced when the table background is
 * changed from the application code, but not reset during skin switch.
